1. CAN communication (can_f103 and can_f767)
	1.1. Every 3 seconds the F767 transmits a CAN packet where the first data byte is an ON/OFF delay and the second byte is the ON/OFF count (the F767 will flash it's red LED to indicate the send). This is read by the F103 which completes the ON/OFF sequence (with its LED), then sends back an acknowledgement CAN packet. When the F767 gets the acknowledgement packet, it will toggle its green LED.
	1.2. The F103 has pin PA12 connected to its CAN transciever TX pin and PA11 connected to its CAN transciever RX pin. This CAN transciever is connected to the other (F767) CAN transciever CANH to CANH and CANL to CANL. The F767 has pin PD1 connected to its CAN transciever TX pin and PD0 connected to its CAN transciever RX pin. Both CAN transcievers are TJA1050 that get common 5V power.

2. SPI communication (spi_f767 and either spi_f103_irq or spi_f103_dma)
	2.1. Every 500 milliseconds the F767 transmits a SPI sequence of length 20, then toggles its blue LED to indicate that this is complete. The F103 interrupt is triggered when the sequence is started, and will collect 20 bytes to fill its buffer, then toggle its red LED to indicate that this was successful. A UART flag is marked, which can be read by the super loop when interrupts are over. When the flag is set, a newline sequence is sent followed by the buffer, then the flag is reset. The IRQ project uses interrupts to accomplish the receive while the DMA project collects the SPI transmission and moves it to memory without the use of the CPU (this would be far more beneficial if the SPI transmission was much longer). In this case, the chip select is not used but can be implemented using the NSS signal available to the SPI peripheral (enabling NSSP mode allows an active low chip select).
	2.2. The F767 has pin PA5 set as the serial clock (SCK) and goes to the F103 PA5 pin. The F767 has PIN PA6 set as the master in slave out (MISO) and goes to the F103 PA6. The F767 has pin PD7 set as the master out slave in (MOSI) and goes to the F103 PA7.
